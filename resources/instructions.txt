- if someone wants services, Leo charges day rate
	- i.e. day rate = $1200/day, and most charge more than that
		- camera all day, we don't charge for transportation 
		- if specialty lenses needed, they have connections and streamlined access to equipment
			- i.e. instead of $700/day, they give $1000 for a couple weeks
			- don't get preferential access
- focus on off-site, indie, artistic, gritty type stuff
- goal: attract talent, funding
- problem: Leo vs. Ernst mentality:
	- reactive vs. proactive way of achieving goals and bringing in resources
