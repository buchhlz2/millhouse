About us: Millhouse Productions is a multimedia content company.  This means we specialize in both original content creation direct from the Millhouse brand and consultative services to clients who want a multimedia solution.  We got our start when founder Leo Milano decided to shoot a Halloween video to win a prize offered by Home Run Inn Pizza. He grabbed his fathers digital camera and never looked back. 
Millhouse productions if first and foremost a production company as it says it in our name. We have a team of creative minds that collaborate to write and create original content. We have produced short movies, web series, trailers, and even a feature film. Our creative team is always writing and collecting scripts for our future projects (if you would like to submit content click link). What separates Millhouse from other production companies? We pride ourselves on two main things that we believe sets our company apart. We are young.
