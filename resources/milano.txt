Founder of Millhouse Productions, Inc. Described as a "tour de force" Mr. Milano has made the most of his young career and has amassed numerous projects both in-front of and behind the camera. The Notre Dame College Prep graduate started creating sketches and short films as a sophomore in high school which led him to Columbia College Chicago film school. It was there Leo spent time developing his director's eye and working on his behind the camera skills. During this period Leo also joined numerous big studio productions working behind of the camera on “Transformers 3”, as well as NBC's “The Playboy Club” and “Chicago Fire.” Over the next three years Leo found himself at home on Chicago's newly rediscovered backlot, known as Cinespace Film Studios. It was on these sound stages Leo cultivated relationships and partnerships giving him the confidence to set out on his own. With Film School in his rear view and a camera on his shoulder Milano dove head first into producing his own first action film, "Redemption" which he both directed and starred in. Shortly after its completion, Leo solidified Millhouse Productions. As a director and an actor Leo also created The TV pilot, "Skool'd" loosely based on his experiences in high school. Once established as a company, Millhouse Productions quickly grew. Collaborations include directing music videos for Aaron Carter and other Chicago based artists. Recently Mr. Milano has added a new feature film to the Millhouse catalogue as he directed "Stix and Stones: The Rabbit Caper" a buddy cop comedy set for release soon.
